        "STORY: There was once a boy who grew up in a wealthy family. His father took him on a trip to show how less fortunate people lived. They stayed on a poor family’s farm, helping with their work. Afterward, the father asked his son what he learned. Surprisingly, the boy said the poor family was lucky. He compared their simple yet fulfilling life to his own, noting their abundance in companionship, nature, and self-sufficiency. The boy realized that wealth is not just about money but also about happiness, relationships, and freedom."
